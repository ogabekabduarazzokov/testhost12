                    <p>Shadow Fight 2 is a role-playing fighting game published by Nekki and developed by Banzai Games. The first version of the game was soft launched on October 9, 2013 while the game was later released worldwide on May 1, 2014 on both Android and iOS platforms, and on January 27, 2015, it was released on Windows 8 and 8.1. On September 13, 2018, it was released for Nintendo Switch as well. The Switch version was the first to introduce real-time versus mode to Shadow Fight 2 via local player-vs-player battles. On March 12, 2019, Nekki announced that the game has been completely rewritten with the Unity engine. The new version was made gradually available to a small number of Android users in order to avoid problems and issues, before it was finally available globally at April 7, 2019.
    
                        This installment introduces the game's events with an animated prologue. In this introduction, the narrator (who is the main character) reveals that he was a legendary combatant. On his travels to find a worthy opponent, he came across and opened the Gates of Shadows, releasing the demons and effectively reducing himself to a shadow. Continuing the theme of its predecessor, players begin the game as an unarmed silhouette. They are then given simple tutorials which familiarize them with the game.
                        
                        Shadow Fight 2 is available in English, German, French, Russian, Chinese (simplified and traditional), Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish, Japanese, and Korean.</p>
